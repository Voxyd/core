# Our utilization of Git

- If you're coding a new feature, then create a new branch
- When the feature is coded, you can merge and delete the feature branch

## Pull requests

We do not care about the number of commits. So, squashing is not useful.

If something is wrong, we discuss in the pull request comments.

In fact : a feature <=> a branch

# Coding style

## Global

- The syntax must be flexible and simple. If someone needs, the code have to be easy to be modified.
- The name of a function/class/variable must be understandable without any comment.
- All functions, classes, variables names must be in English.

## Global - Names

Use mixedCase.

Right :
